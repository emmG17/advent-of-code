Welcome to the Advent of Code Challenges Repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, an annual coding event that takes place in December. Each day, a new coding puzzle is released, and participants solve it using their programming skills.

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for each year. The solutions are implemented in various programming languages, including but not limited to Python, JavaScript, and Java.

If you're not familiar with Advent of Code, it's a yearly event where participants solve coding puzzles that become progressively more challenging as the days go by. You can find more about the event on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each year has a separate folder, and within each year's folder, you'll find subfolders for each day's challenges. The solutions are named according to the puzzle's part (e.g., `part1.py`, `part2.js`).

```
.
└── year
    └── day
        ├── input.txt
        ├── part1.py
        └── part2.py
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmG17/advent-of-code.git
```

2. Navigate to the specific year and day you're interested in.

```bash
cd advent-of-code-challenges/year/day
```

3. Each day's folder contains an `input.txt` file with the puzzle input. Use this input to test the solutions.

## Running the Solutions

Choose the programming language of your choice and execute the corresponding solution file.

For example, if you want to run the Python solution for part 1:

```bash
python part1.py
```

Happy coding!
